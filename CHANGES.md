# CiteRank.com changes on top of Elmo

CiteRank.com runs on Elmo (MIT licence, github.com/elmohq/elmo). This file lists every change we make, so each new Elmo release merges cleanly.

## Rules

- Merge only Elmo's tagged releases (vX.Y.Z), never its main branch.
- Keep our changes to as few files as possible: branding (app name, logo, colours, fonts), plans and prices, and public copy. Prefer environment variables and config over editing Elmo's code.
- Customers never see the name Elmo: not on screens, in emails, page titles, share images or footers. LICENSE.md stays in the repo, as the MIT licence requires.
- Leave Elmo's own CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and README.md untouched; edits there conflict on every update.
- GitHub Actions stay switched off for this repo. Elmo's workflows publish Elmo's packages and drafts, not ours.

## Updating to a new Elmo release

```
git fetch upstream --tags
git merge vX.Y.Z
```

Resolve any conflicts in the files listed below, test, deploy, then add a line to the log.
